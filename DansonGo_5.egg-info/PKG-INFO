        - An excel that includes school names and program names (e.g., [school_list.xlsx](school_list.xlsx))

        ## How to use (Mac)
        
        #### Method 1: Run as package
        
        **Step 1:** Pip Install package from your terminal 
        
        ```python
        pip install DansonGo-5
        ```
        
        
        
        **Step 2:** Generate SOPs
        
        ```python
        from SOP_GEN.GEN_SOP import GEN_SOP
        import os
        
        # Initial parameters
        school_list = "~/school_list.xlsx" # The excel file path of your school and program list
        SOP_temp_file = "~/SOP_template.docx" # The docx file path of your SOP template.
        School_var = "School" # The column name where school names are saved in your school list.
        Program_var = "Program" # The column name where program names are saved in your school list.
        output_path = os.getcwd() # Output path where you want to save your output files.
        
        # Generate SOPs
        GEN_SOP(school_list,SOP_temp_file,School_var,Program_var,output_path).gen_sop()
        
        ```
        
        
        
        
        
        #### Method 2: Run from terminal
        
        **Step 1:** Clone the SOP_GEN from GitHub.
        
        **Step 2:** Run "GEN_SOP.py" in terminal from the folder that contains "GEN_SOP.py" and two prerequisite files.
        
        1. Rename your school list excel file as "school_list.xlsx".
        
        2. In "school_list.xlsx", please make sure that the school and program column names are "School" and "Program", respectively. (TAKE CARE OF THE FIRST CAPITAL LETTER)
        
        3. Rename your docx as "SOP_template.docx"
        
        4. In your "SOP_template.docx", please label the school position as "[SCHOOL_NAME]". Please label the program position as "[PROGRAM_NAME]"
        
        5. Run the command below from terminal
        
        
        ```python
        python GEN_SOP.py
        ```
